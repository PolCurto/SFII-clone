# Street Fighter II Clone

A very simple clone of street fighter II made with C++, and using SDL for the visuals. Currently there are 3 playable characters, with 3 attacks each and their corresponding stages.

In the first screen the player can select one of the three playable characters: Ryu. Guile and Ken. Each character fights in their corresponding stage. The enemy is always Blanka, which performs random actions. 
When one of both characters is defeated, the match ends and the character selection menu shows up again.

## How to play:
*Character selection*
* **Left/Right arrow:** move the character selector to the left/right.
* **Enter:** select the character and start the fight.

*Combat*
* **A/D:** move the character left/right.
* **L:** light punch.
* **K:** kick.
* **H:** throw a projectile.
